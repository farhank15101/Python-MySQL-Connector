# Python-MySQL-Connector

This program uses a text-based interface in Python that allows users to perform several SQL queries on a company database such as adding employees, modifying employee information, viewing employtee details, removing employees, adding dependents, adding departments, and more. Users will be able to do this through user inputs in the program instead of using MySQL directly.
